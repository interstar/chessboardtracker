Chess Board Tracker
===================

OpenFrameworks sketch which uses a chess-board as a drum-machine / sample tracker.

See more here : http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma001pj/chess_board_tracker/index.html

Note you'll need a couple of openFrameworks extensions installed in your project, including

    Maximilian (ofxMaxim)
    ofxDirList
    ofxOpenCv

And a subdirectory "bin/data/sounds" with at least 8 samples in it.
